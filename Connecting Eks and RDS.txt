	Connecting EKS to Rds:
-------------------------
When we create a K8s Eks Cluster a new Vpc with CIDR IP is created.In the same way for RDS a new vpc is created.Aws has a mechanism " Peering Connection " 

Steps:
------
1. In order to setup connection between EKS and RDS create a peering connection between EKS cluster and RDS. The connection should be initiated from RDS VPC to EKS VPC
     
                 RDS(VPC)<====================>EKS-K8S(VPC)
                                         connection create

2. Routing tables need to be updated for both the VPC's

3. For EKS routing table, create a new route with destination which corresponds to CIDR IP of RDS VPC and peering connection as target.

4. Similarly, for RDS routing table, create a new route with destination which corresponds to CIDR IP of EKS VPC and peering connection as target.

5. Now update RDS security Group, add a new rule which allows all traffic from EKS CIDR IP

6. Finally goto "peering connection" and change its configuration by enabling a DNS propagation
