Permissions of Users are governed by an assoiciated AWS role in IAM service.
To create a role which has a full access to all your s3 buckets, just create an s3 service role with AmazonS3 Full Access policy
The role must have trust relationship to transfer.amazonaws.com
(on the role page select Trust relationship and in the access policy Json doc change if needed)

  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "transfer.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

3. Generate a key pair for your new user and paste public key fingerprint SShbox
         ssh-keygen to generate key pair
