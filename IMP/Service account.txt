Create a Service Account:

1. Firstly we need to create a security policy, which will apply for Service Account
       
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
2. Now create a IAM User group and upload the Security policy to it.

   $ iam-groupcreate -g <groupname>
   $ iam-groupuploadpolicy -g <groupname>-p FullControl -f /tmp/fullcontrol_iam_policy.json

3.Create a new user and assign it to new Group.
   
   $ iam-usercreate -u rsdash -g RightScaleDash -k

Note: -k parameter, this instructs the IAM CLI tools to create a new AWS key and secret pair.


Some things like signing your custom Amazon Machine Images (AMI’s) require an x.509 certificate, and 
RightScale has a place for entering this type of “credential” as well, so we’ll create a self signed one for this example.

$ openssl genrsa -out iam.key 1024
$ openssl req -new -key iam.key -out iam.csr
$ openssl x509 -req -in iam.csr -signkey iam.key -out iam.pem
$ iam-useraddcert -u rsdash -f iam.pem

RightScale Configuration:

These steps are very easy, 
describes how you would change the credentials for an existing 
RightScale account since adding your credentials for the first time is handled by the 
RightScale setup wizard.

Once you’ve logged in, hover over the Clouds menu, 
then under AWS Global click the Credentials link.

On the next page, click Edit 
then enter the newly created credentials into the appropriate fields.

That’s it, you’ve just configured your 
RightScale account to use it’s very own AWS credentials!
